## Numerical Methods

This is a numerical methods MATLAB repository based on the implementations required for a Numerical Analysis course I took last fall. Within the available methods we have:

- Bisection Method
- Fixed Point Iteration
- Newton's Method
- Gaussian Quadrature
- Adapative Quadrature
- Gauss-Seidel
- PA = LU factorization
- Runge-Kutta4
- Singular Value Decomposition

Some of the code is based of Dr. Jeff Blanchard's instruction and my collaboration with Jonah and Owen. The upload is still in progress since I have to retouch it and comment it to be presentable. When that is done I will be creating a Python version of all of these.
