This is a numerical methods repository based on the implementations required for a Numerical Analysis course I took last fall. Within the available methods we have:

- Bisection Method
- Fixed Point Iteration
- Newton's Method
- Gaussian Quadrature
- Adapative Quadrature
- Gauss-Seidel
- PA = LU factorization
- Runge-Kutta4
- Singular Value Decomposition

Some of the code is courtesy of Dr. Jeff Blanchard and my collaboration with Jonah and Owen. The upload is still in progress since I have to retouch it and comment it to be presentable.
